how javascript runs in the background
javascript is single threaded

---Javascript Execution Context---
global execution Context
function execution Context
eval execution context

Memory Execution Phase - where variables and functions are stored
Execution Phase - execution is done

--Steps--
1 Global Execution - this is assigned

2 Memory Phase - variables are stored with undefined , functions are stored with their defination

3 Execution Phase - variables are assigned the values which are defined in the code
                    functions are assigned a new environment with a execution thread(new execution context) and same steps follow in this environment from the start ie global , memory and execution
                    the above execution context is deleted after all the steps are performed

--Call Stack --
LIFO basis
